## My name is UnarmedScott

I am developer - back-end, front-end, client-server, anything

I have recently launched [Teramine Forms](https://teramine.com) as a typeform alternative - A no code platform for building web and mobile forms for any purpose.

I have extensive experience in software development including Python, Django, Javascript, React, Java and C/C++. Yes, that means I am an old timer. Been around since the beginning days of the web.

To reach me, email me at UnarmedScott AT gmail dot com.
